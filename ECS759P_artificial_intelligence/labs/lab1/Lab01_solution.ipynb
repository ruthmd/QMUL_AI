    "# ECS759P AI - Lab 1: Basics of coding in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an *interpreted* language. This means that the instructions are executed directly (by an \"interpreter\"), and you do not have to \"compile\" your code. In addition, you do not need to declare a type for your variables since they are dynamically assigned depending on their content or usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses **indentation** (whitespaces, created e.g. with pressing the tab key) to delimit a code block (instead of curly brackets, or begin/end keywords, etc). If you do not indent properly, your code will either not run, or worse, will do something unintended.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to look into some basic functionalities of Python that are needed for the future labs and coursework exercises. You might be familiar with some of them, but please make sure you are comfortable with all of them.\n",

    "## Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment allows us to both enter text and run code interactively. It is called ***[notebook](https://jupyter.org/)***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks can be composed of two types of cells: *Text* and *Code*. You can add your own cells (in Colab, hover your mouse over the edge between two cells, an option should pop up to add either a text cell or a code cell)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit the content of the *text* cells by double-clicking on them. It follows the [markup rules](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to **execute (run) a cell**, you can use one of the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Shift + Enter` : executes a cell and goes to the next one.\n",
    "2. `Ctrl + Enter` : executes a block but stays at the same block.\n",
    "3. The above is equivalent to clicking on the *run* button in the top left menu.\n",
    "4. Use the `Run` tab (at the top of the page), which gives you more options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some useful tricks in Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- While writing a code (in a code-type block), you can use the **`tab`** key for **auto-completion**. You can also use `tab` after a **`dot`** to see a drop-down list of the available attributes and methods on an object or a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another cool feature of the `notebook` environment is that in order to get **help** on anything (a method, a function, an object, etc), you can just put a question mark in front of it (without any space) and execute that line. A help box will appear, which you can close after reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Something to keep in mind is that objects and functions (runtime variables) persist between different cells in the same notebook session. If you want to clear the memory, you can choose \"Run\" and then the \"Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...\" tab from the top-left menu."
